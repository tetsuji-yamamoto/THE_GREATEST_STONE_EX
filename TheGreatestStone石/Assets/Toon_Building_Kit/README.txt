All building parts are facing the z axis by default they can be rotated and arranged to build hundreds of buildings.

All parts have one shared material.

42 total building parts

Use the prefabs under the folder Build your own. Use Vertex Snapping to place the building parts.

All parts are on an angle to be toonish looking once placed together. I have built one demo building to give an idea
of how these are used. It is best if you build you building then add all the parts to an empty game object. After adding
them to the empty game object name it and add the CombineChildren script to it, this will keep the draw calls low.


Remeber that you can build your buildings any size and just scale the roof you choose to the size to fit.

There will be many more kits to come that will be able to interchange with one another.
